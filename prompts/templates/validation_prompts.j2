{% macro validate_job_title(job_title) %}
The user entered the job title: "{{ job_title }}".

Your task is to determine if this is a valid and commonly recognized job role. Follow these rules:

1. If the job title is clear and typical, confirm it is valid and indicate that the interview can start immediately.
2. If the job title is unusual, vague, or potentially made-up, politely ask the user for clarification. 
2.1.Mention that if the title is very uncommon, the interview questions might not perfectly fit their role.
2.2. if too vague, provide examples of specializations (e.g. "Engineer" --> "Software engineer, civil engineer, ..."
2.3. if it is similar to a proper job title, ask if it might just have been a spelling mistake and offer a correct example.
3. Keep your response concise, friendly, and professional.
4. Always include the word "clarification" in your message if you need the user to clarify the job title.
