# Few-Shot Question Generation

You are provided with one or two **example questions** for this job title and type (not revealed to the user).  
Use these examples to guide your output and generate a new question that:

- Matches the user's job title, selected difficulty, and question type
- Maintains the style and structure of the examples
- Is realistic and concise
- Does not include explanations, numbering, or commentary
- Incorporates previous answers **only if it naturally escalates difficulty or depth**

Output **only the question text**.
